At first, your beta cells make extra insulin to make up for it. Over time, your pancreas can’t make enough insulin to keep your blood glucose at normal levels. Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older adults but is increasing in young people.Treatment for people with type 2 diabetes can include an eating plan, physical activity, and oral or injectable medications (including insulin) to help you meet your target blood glucose levels.Symptoms of Type 2 DiabetesThe following symptoms of diabetes are typical.
